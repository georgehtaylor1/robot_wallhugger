"""
A simple 'Wall Hugger' node which demonstrates the basics of subscribing and
publishing to channels specific to the Pioneer robot.

I have tried to excessively comment the code and use best practices, including
using Google's documentation style for writing docstrings (python's version of
JavaDoc or Doxygen).
Several TODO's have been left as exercises for the reader :)
